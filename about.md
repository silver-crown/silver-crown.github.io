### Who am I?

 I come from the ancient glorious kingdom of Norvegia ðŸ‘»
 
 I'm a mystery ðŸ‘» something inexplicable ðŸ‘» an enigma ðŸ‘»

### What do I do?

I make games! I have a few years of gamedev experience both on a professional and hobbyist level. My solo debut is still pending release. ðŸŒ´

as for what technologies I have experience with, it's primarily C# and the Unity Engine in a professional setting. I use C++ with OpenGL in hobby settings, and that's what my 
latest project is built on ðŸ˜±

I also draw my own sprite art and animations >_>

### What is this blog even about

It's a mixture of random chitter chatter and a devlog for my hobby projects. If a big happening happens and I happen to happen upon it, expect it to happen here too :0
