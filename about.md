### Who am I?

I'm a mystery ğŸ‘» something inexplicable ğŸ‘» an enigma ğŸ‘» 

### What do I do?

I make games! I have a few years of gamedev experience both on a professional and hobbyist level. My solo debut is still pending release. ğŸŒ´

###What is this blog even about

It's a mixture of random chitter chatter and a devlog for my hobby projects. If a big happening happens and I happen to happen upon it, expect it to happen here too :0
