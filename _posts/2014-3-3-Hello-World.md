I tried to upgrade my PC yesterday, (making the switch from Intel to AMD) turns out I needed a new aircooler to go with the new motherboard. When I tried to put my old aircooler back into the old rig, a blood sacrifice was made

I also lost a screw somewhere behind the motherboard and now the rig won't boot up anymore ;_; 
guess I'll just be without a PC for the next couple of days until my new cooler arrives...
